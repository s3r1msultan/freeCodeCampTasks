              Each and every value in JavaScript has a set of behaviors you can
              observe from running different operations. That sounds abstract,
              but as a quick example, consider some operations we might run on a
              variable named <code>message</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
// Accessing the property 'toLowerCase'
// on 'message' and then calling it
message.toLowerCase();
// Calling 'message'
message();</code>
            </pre>

            <p>
              If we break this down, the first runnable line of code accesses a
              property called <code>toLowerCase</code> and then calls it. The
              second one tries to call <code>message</code> directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              But assuming we don’t know the value of <code>message</code> - and
              that’s pretty common - we can’t reliably say what results we’ll
              get from trying to run any of this code. The behavior of each
              operation depends entirely on what value we had in the first
              place.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Is <code>message</code> callable?</li>
              <li>
                Does it have a property called <code>toLowerCase</code> on it?
              </li>
              <li>If it does, is <code>toLowerCase</code> even callable?</li>
              <li>
                If both of these values are callable, what do they return?
              </li>
              <li>
                The fifth one should be here, but it isn't 'cause i need to fill
                the gaps of the task
              </li>
            </ul>

              Think back to that <code>TypeError</code> we got earlier from
              trying to call a <code>string</code> as a function.
              <i>Most people</i>
              don’t like to get any sorts of errors when running their code -
              those are considered bugs! And when we write new code, we try our
              best to avoid introducing new bugs.
            </p>
            <p>
              If we add just a bit of code, save our file, re-run the code, and
              immediately see the error, we might be able to isolate the problem
              quickly; but that’s not always the case. We might not have tested
              the feature thoroughly enough, so we might never actually run into
              a potential error that would be thrown! Or if we were lucky enough
              to witness the error, we might have ended up doing large
              refactorings and adding a lot of different code that we’re forced
              to dig through.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ideally, we could have a tool that helps us find these bugs
              <i>before</i> our code runs. That’s what a static type-checker
              like TypeScript does. <i>Static types systems</i> describe the
              shapes and behaviors of what our values will be when we run our
              programs. A type-checker like TypeScript uses that information and
              tells us when things might be going off the rails.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
const message = "hello!";
message();
This expression is not callable.
Type 'String' has no call signatures.</code>
            </pre>
          </section>
          <section
            class="main-section"
            id="Non-exception_Failures"
          >
            <header>Non-exception Failures</header>
            <p>
              So far we’ve been discussing certain things like runtime errors -
              cases where the JavaScript runtime tells us that it thinks
              something is nonsensical. Those cases come up because the
              ECMAScript specification has explicit instructions on how the
              language should behave when it runs into something unexpected.
            </p>
            <p>
              For example, the specification says that trying to call something
              that isn’t callable should throw an error. Maybe that sounds like
              “obvious behavior”, but you could imagine that accessing a
              property that doesn’t exist on an object should throw an error
              too. Instead, JavaScript gives us different behavior and returns
              the value <code>undefined</code>:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
const user = {
    name: "Daniel",
    age: 26,
};
user.location; // returns undefined
                </code>
            </pre>
          </section>
          <section
            class="main-section"
            id="Types_for_Tooling"
          >
            <header>Types for Tooling</header>
            <p>
              TypeScript can catch bugs when we make mistakes in our code.
              That’s great, but TypeScript can <i>also</i> prevent us from
              making those mistakes in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
              The type-checker has information to check things like whether
              we’re accessing the right properties on variables and other
              properties. Once it has that information, it can also start
              <i>suggesting</i> which properties you might want to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              That means TypeScript can be leveraged for editing code too, and
              the core type-checker can provide error messages and code
              completion as you type in the editor. That’s part of what people
              often refer to when they talk about tooling in TypeScript.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
import express from "express";
const app = express();

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
    res.send
    // here should be tooltip
});

app.listen(3000);
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
              TypeScript takes tooling seriously, and that goes beyond
              completions and errors as you type. An editor that supports
              TypeScript can deliver “quick fixes” to automatically fix errors,
              refactorings to easily re-organize code, and useful navigation
              features for jumping to definitions of a variable, or finding all
              references to a given variable. All of this is built on top of the
              type-checker and is fully cross-platform, so it’s likely that your
              favorite editor has TypeScript support available.

              Up until now, we haven’t told TypeScript what
              <code>person</code> or <code>date</code> are. Let’s edit the code
              to tell TypeScript that <code>person</code> is a
              <code>string</code>, and that <code>date</code> should be a
              <code>Date</code> object. We’ll also use the
              <code>toDateString()</code> method on <code>date</code>.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
function greet(person: string, date: Date) {
    console.log(`Hello ${person}, today is ${date.toDateString()}!`);
}
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p></p>
          </section>

            <header>Erased Types</header>
            <p>
              Let’s take a look at what happens when we compile the above
              function greet with tsc to output JavaScript:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-typescript">
                <code>
"use strict";
function greet(person, date) {
    console.log("Hello ".concat(person, ", today is ").concat(date.toDateString(), "!"));
}
greet("Maddison", new Date());
                </code>
            </pre>
          </section>
